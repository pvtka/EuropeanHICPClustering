# European HICP Clustering

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing and clustering European countries based on their Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Using data from the Eurostat database, this project visualizes trends in HICP over time and groups countries with similar price inflation patterns.

## Features

- **Eurostat Data Retrieval**: Automates the fetching of HICP data from the Eurostat database.
- **Data Filtering and Transformation**: Pre-processes the data to exclude certain geographical areas and focus on relevant countries and time frames.
- **Time Series Visualization**: Generates line plots to visualize HICP trends across different European countries.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Applies hierarchical clustering to group countries based on their HICP trends, highlighting similarities in inflation patterns.

### Technology

- R
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `eurostat`, `dplyr`
